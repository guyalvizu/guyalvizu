# Guy Alvizu

I'm a self-taught AI and Python engineer with a background in IT operations and real-world scripting. My focus is building practical automation tools and AI-powered workflows that deliver real value — not just demos.

---

## Current Focus

- Building Python-based automation tools using Google Apps Manager (GAM) for user and system management
- Developing AI-powered workflows to reduce repetitive tasks and save time across technical and administrative roles
- Mastering prompt engineering with an emphasis on performance, control, and integration into larger systems

---

## What I’m Learning Now

- AI agent architecture using frameworks like CrewAI and LangChain
- Orchestrating LLMs to solve multi-step, real-world problems
- API integration and scalable deployment for internal tools and automation

---

## What's Coming

In the next 90 days, I’ll be publishing:
- Custom Python scripts for Google Admin environments (GAM-based tools)
- Modular prompt packs designed for operations, tech support, and time-saving workflows
- Lightweight agent prototypes designed to replace busywork with intelligence
